BAM Car Dealership would like to implement an application where they can keep track of 
their inventory and give potential customers an easy way to browse the inventory.  The 
application would store data about the dealerships inventory and details about the cars
in stock such as make, model, miles, and price.  There will be Managers that will 
add and remove cars from the application. The Managers will need to be authenticated
by the application.  A Manager can add other Managers to the application to delegate
workload.
Any potential customer can view cars in the dealerships inventory by browsing or by 
searching.  A potential customer can view a car in stock and ask the dealership a question
about the car they are viewing.  The potential customer should be well informed of any cars
they may be interested in purchasing when they visit the dealership.
